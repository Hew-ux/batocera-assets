The "Batocera Music Vol. 2" package can be downloaded from the content downloader to use these tracks in your Batocera installation.

If you want to still use these tracks manually, you can download them and place them into `/userdata/music/`. We suggest using the OGG files, as they are normalized and smaller in size.
