The background menu music that plays in Batocera that has since been retired from active use. 

Most of them can be downloaded via the content downloader in Batocera, though it's still possible to just manually place the files in `/userdata/music` yourself if you want to.

Batocera used to use Recalbox's BGM. Those can be found at ... ??? (install Recalbox and get the music for yourself? There's no official way to just see it on the internet... you could also see the previous version in Batocera's git history: https://github.com/batocera-linux/batocera.linux/commit/5724a0bf5d5e7a89607f3c9c37e06af177525f00 )
